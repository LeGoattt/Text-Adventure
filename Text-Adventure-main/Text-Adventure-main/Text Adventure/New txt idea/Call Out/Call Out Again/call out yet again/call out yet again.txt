Really? Still trying are we? A shame. But fine I'll allow it- You take a moment to think leaning forward you pool a decent cup of water into your mouth, drinking up whatever you can- trying to satisfy your aching, dry throat. With this newfound moisture in your system. You manage to make a noise.. Congrats. You screamt the most pathetic scream that has ever been made. A raspy, almost whistle like noise that tears from your lips shamefully. What? Did you expect something to happen? Who would hear you down here? No one.

GOOD JOB- You got ending #2. "Wasting your time like an idiot". Congrats.
