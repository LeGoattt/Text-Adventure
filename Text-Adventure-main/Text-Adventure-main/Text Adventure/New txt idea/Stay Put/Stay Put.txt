You bide your time. waiting amongst the darkness... Nothing happens as expected, what would come of inaction after all? The fact you're down here is evidence enough no one cares to aid you. To even recall your existence... Though I cannot blame you. Waiting for death may just be the best thing you can do here, why continue to live in such a state. Surviving off of a few droplets of water falling from above your head, living in darkness. Unable to even walk around your cave- Unable to see how large your prison even is. Yes... Perhaps death would be a mercy
