. . . plop, plop, plop. That's all you can hear, that's all you've been able to hear. For what feels as though an eternity. Shackled to a cold and wet wall, deep inside a damp cave- the lack of light engulfing you in darkness, the cold biting at your skin. All the while- That steady patter of droplets fall from above your head, right infront of you. This water being the only reason you've even survived this long. plop.. plop.. plop..
