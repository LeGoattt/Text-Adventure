Fine... You want something to happen? It will. Under all the sudden jostling the, long forgotten rusted chains prove to have a weak link... Snapping. You fall face first into the cold harsh stone. Pain.. Pain overshadowed by the joy you feel at finally being free- The thick murky blood leaking from your nose. Creating puddle as you lay there- Seeping into your mouth. With all of the previous struggling you find yourself having a hard time sitting up... After an undetermined amount of time being chained perfectly still. Your body isn't built for movement.. It's still just trying to survive
