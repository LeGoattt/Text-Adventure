You just didn't listen to me huh? What did you think that would do? You'd just go boom I'm ready to move around again... No. You're screwed but sure I'll let you kill yourself... Attempting to find a way out or really anythng you decide to push once more. Forcing yourself off the wall- Wobbling forward the blunt force of the exhaustion hits you. Your eyes roll backwards as your body shuts itself down. Falling head first into the harsh jagged stone floor, which then cracks your head open

GOOD JOB. You got ending #4 "Passed tf out" ending
