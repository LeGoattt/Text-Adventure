And a wonderful sleep it is, I'd say the perfect rest- A good full 10 hours of rest you just had, stirring just moments later, you find yourself having sat down leaning against the wall. With all this newfound energy you shakily make your way to your feet. You have a few things to consider at this point
1. You have to worry about your Hunger% or H = x%. 
2. You have to worry about your Thirst% or T = x%
3. You have to worry about that very sentient and cognitive parasite that infected your body whilst you were sleeping and is now attempting to take it over, yes. That's right, have fun with that. Dont be too impulsive and put yourself in danger and it wont take over. stay too compliant and it'll take over just slower. It's up to you to figure out what to do with it now
