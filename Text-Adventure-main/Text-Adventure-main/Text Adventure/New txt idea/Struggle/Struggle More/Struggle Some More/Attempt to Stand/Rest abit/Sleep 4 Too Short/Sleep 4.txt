Gee, I wonder why you haven't slept sooner than this. You could have avoided a good bit of trouble if you had just taken a nap, though perhaps you dispise sleep given how short your nap just was- Did you expect that to do anything to restore your energy? You slept at most 20 minutes. So silly of you- Ah well. You rest for your miniscule amount of time and fall flat on your face when you try to move. because you aren't at all energized... Good job player. You suck

YIPPEE You got ending #7 "You suck at sleeping" ending
