You decide it would be a good idea to shut your eyes for a moment. Rest... Gather your strength... What a fool you are- So overjoyed by your escape you failed to consider if you'd even wake up. You rest... rest. Continue to rest unable to wake- Slowly but surely the blood seeping from your nose floods the ground under you, not alot but it is enough to cut off your oxygen... Unable to stand or move- You drown. Drown in your own puddle of blood. A gruesome way to go isn't it?
