Sleep, ah sleep- What a wonderful thing, such restoration to your body caused by simply shutting your eyes. We all love sleep to some extent- You in particular seems to love sleep farrr more than the usual. Given you've slept for an entire 3 days, 3 days in an already starved and dehydrated body? yeah. A shame for you but this is the end of the line

GOOD On ya. got Ending #6 "Starved in your sleep" ending
