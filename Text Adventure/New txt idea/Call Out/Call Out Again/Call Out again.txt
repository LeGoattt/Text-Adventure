Despite this setback, a burst of determination pushes you forth. To get atleast a Sound out. Just one small sound that's all- Gathering up all your strength, taking in the deepest breath you can muster- Gaining all your resolve only- To fail. Once again... Nothing changes- You cant do a single thing. You cant scream I already told you that. What are you stupid? Dont try again, pick another option.

|Call out yet again
|Struggle
|Stay Put
