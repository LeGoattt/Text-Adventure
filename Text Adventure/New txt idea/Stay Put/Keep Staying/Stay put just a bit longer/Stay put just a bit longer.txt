And that's just what you do, stay put.... Sitting still is all your good for anymore isn't it? As your body consumes itself. The few nutrients it had run out, the water above so close yet you haven't the strength to even lean your head forward and drink it. You sit... And sit. And slowly but surely you die... Die alone in a dark cave. With nothing to show for it- No loved ones to see you off, no one to honor your death. Not even a soul around- You aren't even worth the pity of an insect.

CONGRATS You got ending #1 "Died alone in a cave" GOOD Job sitting still like that- I know it was so hard typing in three prompts instead of just doing something more interesting. Annyway retry?
